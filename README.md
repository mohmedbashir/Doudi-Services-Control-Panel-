# Doudi Services (Branch Manager App)

A dedicated mobile application for branch managers of Doudi Services, built using Flutter, designed to simplify and streamline the process of submitting customer service requests directly to the control panel for processing and execution.

This app serves as the bridge between customers and the operations team—allowing managers to quickly create and track orders for services like internet packages, SIM issuance, router installation, and more.

## Key Features
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with branch managers in mind—making it easy to submit and manage customer service requests on the go.

* **Order Submission**: Quickly send new customer orders (e.g., router installation, SIM card issuance) directly to the central control panel. Orders are processed in real-time.

* **Request Tracking**: Stay updated on the status of all submitted orders—whether they’re approved, rejected, or completed—with detailed request history.

* **Push Notifications**: Receive instant alerts for updates, such as request approvals, required actions, or payment reminders.
