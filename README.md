# Doudi Services (Control Panel)

A dedicated control panel for a mobile service center, built using **Flutter**  designed to manage various service requests such as internet packages, SIM card issuance, router installation requests, and more. The panel receives incoming requests submitted by app users (branch managers), which are then processed accordingly—either fulfilled, escalated, or handled based on the type of service required.

## Key Features
* **Student Dashboard**: Provides access to assignments, announcements, grades, and attendance records
* **Parental Control**: Enables parents to use their child's ID number for parental control.
* **Instructor Communication and Notifications**: Allows students to communicate with instructors and receive notifications for upcoming tests and events.
* **Teacher Management**: there is a separate app version for teachers to manage assignments, interact with students, and view important information.
